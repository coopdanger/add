Applications Using DoH (ADD)

Description: Discussions at the DoG WG and a side meeting at IETF104 suggest
there appears to be significant interest in examining in the operational
aspects of DoH deployment, particularly in operator and enterprise networks.
This lead to the creation of the ADD (Applications Doing DNS) mailing list
where some of these issues have been discussed. The proposed BoF intends to
establish if there are sufficient potential work items and enough interest at
the IETF to justify the creation of a new Working Group which would focus on
these topics.
